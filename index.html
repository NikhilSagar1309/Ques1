    <h1> <u><strong>Nature</strong></u></h1>
  </center>
  <p> <strong>Nature</strong>, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical,
    material world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena
    of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of
    nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans
    are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate
    category from other natural phenomena.</p>
  <p>The word <em>nature</em> is borrowed from the Old French <em>nature</em> and is derived
    from the Latin word <em>natura</em>, or "essential qualities, innate disposition",
    and in ancient times, literally meant <em>"birth"</em>. In ancient philosophy, <em>natura</em> is
    mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word <em>physis</em> (φύσις), which originally
    related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the
    world develop of their own accord. The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe,
    is one of several expansions of the original notion; it began with certain core applications of
    the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus),
    and has steadily gained currency ever since. During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries,
    nature became the passive reality, organized and moved by divine laws. With the Industrial revolution, nature increasingly
    became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention: it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions
    (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history (Hegel, Marx). However, a vitalist
    vision of nature, closer to the presocratic one, got reborn at the same time, especially after Charles Darwin. </p>

      <h1><u>Earth</u></h1>
    </a>

  </center>
  <p>Earth is the only <em>planet</em> known to support life, and its natural features are the subject of many fields of
    scientific research. Within the <em>Solar System</em>, it is third closest to the Sun; it is the largest <em>terrestrial
    planet</em> and the fifth largest overall. Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions,
    two relatively narrow <em>temperate</em> zones, and a wide <em>equatorial</em> tropical to <em>subtropical</em> region. <em>Precipitation</em>
    varies widely with location, from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre. 71 percent of
    the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans. The remainder consists of continents and islands, with
    most of the inhabited land in the <em>Northern Hemisphere</em>.</p>

      <h1><u>Water on the Earth</u></h1>
    </a>

  </center>
  <p><strong>Water</strong> is a <em>chemical</em> substance that is composed of <em>hydrogen and oxygen</em> (H<sub>2</sub>O) and is vital for all known forms
    of life. In typical usage, water refers only to its liquid form or <em>state</em>, but the substance also has a solid
    state, <em>ice</em>, and a <em>gaseous</em> state, <em>water</em> vapor, or <em>steam</em>. Water covers 71% of the <em>Earth's surface</em>. On Earth,
    it is found mostly in oceans and other large bodies of water, with 1.6% of water below ground in <em>aquifers</em>
    and 0.001% in the <em>air</em> as <em>vapor</em>, clouds, and <em>precipitation</em>. Oceans hold 97% of surface water, <em>glaciers</em>,
    and polar <em>ice caps</em> 2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds 0.6%. Additionally,
    a minute amount of the Earth's water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.</p>

    <h2><u>Oceans</u></h2>
  </a>

  <p>An ocean is a major body of <em>saline water</em>, and a principal component of the hydrosphere. Approximately
    71% of the Earth's surface (an area of some 361 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a<em> continuous
    body of water</em> that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas. More than half of
    this area is over 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) deep. Average oceanic <em>salinity</em> is around 35 <em>parts per thousand</em>  (ppt)
    (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt.
    Though generally recognized as several 'separate' oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the <em>World Ocean</em> or global ocean.
    This concept of a global ocean as a continuous body of water with relatively free interchange among its parts is of fundamental importance to <em>oceanography</em>.</p>

    <h2><u>Lakes</u></h2>
  </a>

  <p>A lake (from Latin word lacus) is a <em>terrain feature</em> (or physical feature), a body
    of liquid on the surface of a world that is localized to the bottom of <em> basin</em>
    (another type of landform or terrain feature; that is, it is not global)
    and moves slowly if it moves at all. On Earth, a body of water is considered
    a lake when it is inland, not part of the ocean, is larger and deeper than a
    pond, and is fed by a river. The only world other than Earth known to harbor
    lakes is <em>Titan</em>, Saturn's largest moon, which has lakes of ethane, most likely
    mixed with <em>methane</em>.It is not known if Titan's lakes are fed by rivers, though Titan's surface is carved by numerous river beds. Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, <em>rift zones</em>, and areas with ongoing or recent
    <em>glaciation</em>. Other lakes are found in <em>endorheic basins</em> or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last <em>Ice Age</em>. All lakes are temporary over
    geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.</p>
  <a id="5">
    <h2><u>Rivers</u></h2>
  </a>
  <p>A river is a natural <em>watercourse,</em> usually <em>freshwater</em>, flowing towards an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river.
    In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up completely before reaching another body of water.
    Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one
    example is <em>Burn</em> in Scotland and North-east England. Sometimes a river is said to be larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language.
    A river is part of the <em>hydrological cycle</em>. Water within a river is generally collected from <em>precipitation</em> through <em>surface runoff, groundwater</em> recharge,<em> springs</em> , and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from glaciers).
  </p>
  <a id="6">
    <h2><u>Streams</u></h2>
  </a>
  <p>A stream is a flowing body of water with a <em>current</em>, confined within a bed and <em>stream banks</em>. In the United States, a stream
    is classified as a watercourse less than 60 feet (18 metres) wide. Streams are important as conduits in the water cycle,
    instruments in groundwater recharge, and they serve as corridors for fish and wildlife migration. The biological habitat in the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a <em>riparian zone</em>. Given the status of the ongoing Holocene extinction, streams
    play an important corridor role in connecting fragmented habitats and thus in conserving <em>biodiversity</em>. The study of streams and waterways in general involves many branches of inter-disciplinary natural science and engineering, including
    <em>hydrology, fluvial geomorphology, aquatic ecology, fish biology, riparian ecology</em>, and others.</p>
